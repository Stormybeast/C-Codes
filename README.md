# C-Codes
C++ codes for different tasks. You can reuse the codes as and when u like. But be true and do not just copy the codes, try to understand them first. U r free to edit them however you like. They are not optimized so you are welcome to optimize them. But yes, I can guarantee that they get the work done properly.
